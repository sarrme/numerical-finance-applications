# Some numerical finance application

Computing of the underlying under the Black and Scholes model and portefolio simulation. 

Testing Euler and Milstein approximation in approximation stochastic processus and comparition between the two methods in terms of weak and strong error. 

Computing the sensitivities of the payoff based on finite difference and Monte Carlo as a first approach, then through the use of Milliavin and the Flow technics.
